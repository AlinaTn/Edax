            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>
              With the increased exposure to tourists, historical monuments are at an ever-growing risk of disappearing.
			  Building Information Modelling (BIM) offers a process of digitally documenting of all the features that are made or incorporated into the building over its life-span, thus affords unique opportunities for information preservation. 
			  BIM of historical buildings are called Historical Building Information Models (HBIM). 
			  This involves documenting a building in detail throughout its history. 
              In this project, we discuss how to establish an architectural infrastructure and database of a heritage site, preserve and then interact with it through an immersive environment that leverages BIM for exploring historic buildings. 
			  In our proposed approach, the site is based on many factors such as architectural value, size, and accessibility. 
			  The 3D model is extracted from the public data about the Romanian ethnographic outdoor monuments, after which the elements of the 3D objects are identified by creating a database using the BIM software platform (Autodesk Revit). 
			  The use of modern and widely accessible game engine technology (Unity3D) is explored, allowing the user to fully embed and interact with the scene using handheld devices. The details of implementing an integrated pipeline between HBIM, GIS and augmented and virtual reality (AVR) tools and the findings of the work are presented.

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
              Cultural and historical heritages form an integral part of the national identity. 
			  Heritage sites, structures and monuments play a major role in the collective memory of a society. 
			  Such sites act as a bridge between the present and the past, and offer attractive landmarks to the city, while attracting foreign tourists, which, in turn, can help boost local economies. 
			  Therefore, there is an increasing need for proper documentation and preservation of heritage sites and monuments using modern technologies. 
			  Sufficient documentation helps to monitor the unavoidable degradation of sites due to natural disasters, negligence or traumatic events, such as war. 
			  Together, this helps build better maintenance and more effective management systems and tools for heritage sites.
			  In the past, heritage documentation mainly relied on human interpretation such as hand drawings, on-site measurement, sculptures, and pictures, which was time consuming and less precise. 
			  The power of technology has been increasingly utilized in recent years due to the evolution of architectural visualization from paper drawing to screen displaying to virtual 3D, which provided for better understanding, visual communication and interaction within a scene; it also provided additional ways to capture and display the materials, colors, decorative information, and so forth, in order to obtain more accurate results. 
              Virtual Reality (VR) is defined by Steuer (1992) as “a real or simulated environment in which a perceiver experiences telepresence”. 
			  The use of e-documentation has the potential to integrate with an enhanced virtual environment where the user can experience a virtual walk through the heritage site without having to visit it physically. It also can help tourists in choosing potential sites to visit before planning their travel. 
			  In a similar way, an augmented reality (AR) system is a combination between real and computer-created information interactively in a real environment, and in real time which aligns virtual objects with real world/physical ones (Höllerer & Feiner, 2004). 
			  Thus, it can also be used to project computer-generated objects onto the heritage site to digitally re-construct a particular time in history, giving the user a more fulfilling experience. Buckland & Wilcock (1973) predicted that computers would be used to reconstruct archaeological sites. 
			  Indeed, the first step towards 3D e-documentation of archaeological objects was published little more than 10 years later, in 1985, by Leo Biek. 
			  Later, extensive research was conducted on electronic and digital documentation of sites and artefacts, such as: The Roman Bath and the Roman military bathhouse at Caerleon, South Wales (Arnold et al., 1989); Michelangelo’s sculptures (ten statues, including the David) in Florence, Italy (Levoy et al., 2000); and, An ancient marble map of Rome, the Forma Urbis Romae, approximated 18m in width by 13m in height which constructed in the early 3rd century (Koller & Levoy, 2006).

            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>
              As the target of the proposed project is to create a holistic application for immersive environment applications, the final output will have multiple facets, and depending on the requirement, 3D models with different levels of details and links to contextual information. 
			  To use the created model for the proposed holistic application, it will be required to feed the models to AVR platforms and to collate the necessary historical and architectural information that will be useful for documentation, preservation, and tourism purposes. 
			  The capabilities of the currently available VR and AR tools will be blended and used in an integrated way, enabling the users to virtually experience and interact with the site from remote locations. 
			  The work is based on a digital library of the heritage architectural elements of the Europeana site in order to study and understand the evolution of the architectural heritage of the cities. This library will also be helpful for possible future applications, such as physical reconstruction of degraded monuments, gaming designs and educational purposes.

                  <a href="#integration-section">Integration of Data Acquisition Methods and Generation of 3D Models </a>
				  
				  In the first part of this proposed work, four types of methods are used and integrated as needed; namely, Close Range Photogrammetry (CRP), Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), Structure from Motion-Multi View Stereo (SfM-MVS) and CAD modelling in order to have complete 3D model details. 
				  The appropriate integration of the point-clouds to generate the most accurate 3D model requires careful inspection of the acquired data and creation of a suitable workflow. 
				  Thus, the 3D models generated are used in the following stages of work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="#library-section">Generation of an Architectural Element Library and Study of the Heritage and Its Evolution </a>
				  
				  To generate a library of the architectural elements of the created 3D model, it is required to identify and categorize the different architectural elements of the site. 
				  For example, the typical historical buildings of the area have distinguishable features such as: 
				  (a)Typical wooden windows, ‘Roshans’ (large projecting three-sided wooden structure on building facades) 
                  (b)Carved and ornamental doors (mostly used for main entrances) 
                  (c)Creative forms of lattice work and fretted decorations such as Shish or Mashrabiya, which are mostly integrated into Roshans 
                  (d)Sgraffito (decorative plasterwork) (Alitany, 2014). This proposed library consists of models of such features, properly categorized and structured. 
				  A thorough study of the elements and their histories will be carried out to provide information about the elements in order to facilitate future research and studies on the evolution of heritage. 
				  In addition, it will act as a reference point for required reconstruction and model refinement work. 
				  Moreover, it will also help the designers to work with period movies, games and educational applications.

                  <a href="#HBIM-section">HBIM integrated with Geospatial Information System</a>
				  
				  Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a new standard for CAD drafting in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Owner/Operator (AECO) industries. 
				  This technology will play an important role in the design, reconstruction, maintenance of buildings, and for managing the essential building information in a digital format throughout the building lifecycle (Succar, 2009; Succar & Kassem, 2015). 
				  The integration of heritage recording and BIM can document and manage historic buildings. 
				  This method takes into account historical data, and layers in plug-in libraries that represent historical components of the buildings, including both geometric and non-geometric attributes and relationships. 
				  The first step in the HBIM process is the remote collection of data set using terrestrial laser scanning with/or photogrammetry methods. 
				  Next, is designing a library of parametric architectural objects that could be used for the digital modelling of many historic buildings. 
				  Afterwards, these library objects are integrated with a technique for procedural modelling based on architectural rules and proportions automatically. 
				  Finally, the HBIM model is completed with a combination of the manual refinement of the automated model and manual placement of other required library objects. 
				  Models are usually extracted by experts to reach the maximum level of detail of the geometric representation, which mostly represent existing real world models in the form of geospatial information systems (de Laat and van Berlo, 2011). 
				  Once the HBIM model is generated, the next stage involves the integration of the 3D model into GIS for further management and analysis in order to have non-architectural information such as vector datasets, raster datasets, and attribute data. 
				  A Geographic Information System (GIS) provides means for storing, visualising and analysing geographic data. 
				  Information, which is stored in database tables, is associated with geographic locations (map data) in order to spatially analyse data. Traditionally, GIS systems are compatible with 2D map data. 
				  However, latest developments allow for the development of 3D GIS systems, which have much better capabilities for management, analysis and visualisation of increasingly heterogeneous collections of data. 
				  Many applications and computer systems are designed for virtual reality that can be visited and navigated using maps. 
				  The integration between virtual reality technology and leading geographic information systems (GIS) will enhance the role of GIS as a unique information container and decrease the gap between geographic information with two dimensions and three dimensions, which represents a new generation of GIS.

                  <a href="#application-section">Development of a Holistic Application Based on AVR platforms</a>
				  
				  Virtual Reality (VR) can be thought of as a precursor to Augmented Reality (AR). 
				  VR technologies can completely immerse a user in a synthetic environment and the users can be separated from the real world around them. 
				  By contrast, AR allows the users to see the real world in real time enhanced with virtual object information, once they are coordinated correctly in order to display a coherent superposition. 
				  Merging the real and virtual worlds in a mixed reality system generates a new environment where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact. 
				  Augmented reality (AR) and augmented virtuality (AV) are located between virtual environment (VE) and real environment (RE), while AV is closer to VE and AR is closer to RE. 
				  There are many different ways to stimulate AR. One of the earliest and most well-known ways is:
				  (a).Marker and image recognition: It recognizes the image or a particular feature on the image. 
                  (b).Geospatial augmented reality: It can recognize the location. 
				  The concept for the AR application is the use of GPS that is already in the device to synchronize location data to BIM models. 
				  Therefore, the devices used such as tablets or smartphones would recognise the exact location using GPS coordinates and be able to overlay the corresponding site information from the BIM model on top of the real-world view. 
				  It gives the users the ability to see the 3D virtual view of the whole construction overlaid on the real-world view of the worksite easily. 
				  In the work of Keil et al. (2011), an iPhone-based App was developed as a history and architecture guide for tourism on a cultural heritage site: Darmstadt Artist’s Colony, the Josef Maria Olbrich House, as the main example. 
				  The App provides textual background information on the architect and offers a 3D model view when run in ‘classic information tour’ mode (Fig. 9). 
				  However, when run in ‘augmented reality tour’ mode, the user can take a snapshot of the building ahead, and the App, after identifying the building, shows a 3D reconstruction of the building with information on the different elements of the building that have changed or are missing as an independent model viewed in the browser. 
				  The 3D reconstruction reacts to user movements and changes its orientation and scale in response to the user’s position using data from the phone’s GPS and compass. 
				  It also responds to two-finger multi-touch pinch, zoom and rotating gestures. 
				  Although this App can provide the user with important information and a 3D model, the model used in this App has a sketch-like rendering, which curtails the ‘Reality’ aspect of AVR. Thus, the architectural elements of the model cannot be examined in detail. 
				  Once the selected 3D model is generated, it is fed into AVR Platforms (Desktop PC, TV, wall mounted displays, 3D glasses or Head-mounted displays) to provide the user with an immersive experience. Historical Models with different levels of detail (LoD) are required for different purposes. 
				  For example, in the preservation model, a very high level of detail is necessary. Whereas in the model to be used for providing information to the tourists, relatively lower levels of detail are required to facilitate smooth visualization and interaction (typically on computationally limited hardware). 
				  High level of detail means large data volume, which may be difficult to render in the portable device that a tourist will be using. 
				  Primarily, there are two components of the proposed application. 
				  The VR component of the application enables the users to virtually walk past and inspect the models by using some interactive device.

            <h1>General description of the web-system</h1>
            <p>
              The framework and its components are explained in details. 
			  The framework is composed of five generic modules: User access manager, Data integration and management, 3D Library Manager, Presentation/Visualisation, Geospatial web browsers.  
			  Each component may be furthered broken down into number of sub-components.
			  At the most fundamental level of the framework, the data module must cover two components to provide the necessary data for the platform to work. 
			  These include a 3D Data Store which is the repository of nearly all major required data for the platform; and an External Data Interface which includes interfaces for communication with external data services such as Web Mapping Service (WMS) or Web Feature Service (WFS). Real-time integration of these services with the system may create added value by consolidation of up-to-date data from different data/service providers and avoiding redundancy in data storage. 
			  Utilization of suitable acquisition methods and quality and consistency check for integration becomes critical here. 
			  This falls under the authority of the data integration and management module at the higher level. 
			  Data integration and interoperability components in this module such as data acquisition (import) and export components, integrity and consistency checking component, and convertor components are responsible for integrating the data from a variety of sources, the necessary data conversion, possible exports to other platforms via download or web service, as well as their quality assurance to comply with possible defined rules by the administrator in the platform.
			  This layer is also responsible for establishing and managing the database through the data store interface API component. 
			  This extensible module allows for definition of different syntax and objects which are used for establishing and working with different kinds of databases. It also makes it flexible for users to choose the database based on their purpose and preferences.
              The Data integration and management module, in general, maintains constant connection between the core of the system and the quality data from variety of sources. 
			  The User access manager component is responsible for managing users, their access level to data and other functions of the system. 
			  The 3D library manager on the other hand is designed for managing the 3D models library in the system. 
			  Models in this library can be incorporated along with geometry of the urban objects during their definition to allow photorealistic view of the monuments. 
			  The most important component in this module is the Analysis and Modeling component which is further broken into a number of integrated sub-components.
			  Modeling functions are defined using the API of the platform and managed in the model manager sub-component.
              In addition to these, external modeling services (external individual functions or a complete model) can be integrated to the model manager and used in modeling a particular scenario. It is the responsibility of the model coordinator to manage inputs and outputs of each model and coordinate the order of execution. 
			  Object definition and reconfiguration is another component which is integrated with its counterpart in the visualisation module to define, modify or remove objects in the data store. The data processing component in this module processes raw data from the database and external sources and converts them into the data model of the platform for analysis and visualization.
			  These processed data then are sent to the visualization coordinator. 
			  The coordinator module must communicate with the modeling and analysis component to be able to integrate results of modeling and those from data processing unit and pass them to view manager to determine how the visualization will be performed and prepare suitable data for that purpose.   	
              Due to different nature of components in the framework and importance of effective communication between them, interoperability must be assured throughout the platform between its modules as a requirement. 
			  A comprehensive data model is then needed to be designed for this purpose. Each component should know how to communicate with the others. 
			  Hence, the data model needs to be sufficiently rich to support syntactic and semantic interoperability for effective data exchange between external sources and internal components of the platform. 
			  The API of the platform on the other hand is required to be designed so that its further extension becomes possible. 
              Lastly, the presentation module is responsible for visualization of the result and satisfies the requirements introduced in visualization as well as the user interface groups. 
			  The 3D viewer(s) of the platform are the most important components in this module and are defined here. In addition, interfaces for data definition, importing/exporting and management of other parts of the platform should be developed in this layer. The Model Designer is another important component and is responsible for visually managing the definition and integration of models within one or more scenarios. 
			  It is connected to the workflow engine of the system and uses the metadata of defined models to visually create a workflow.

            <h1>Architecture implementation aspects</h1>
            <p>
              In this section, the architecture of the system and the technologies used for the development are explained. 
			  The prototype system could be develop using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) in four conceptual layers – i.e. data layer, data access layer, engine, and presentation layer. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) was utilized to develop modules in all these layers. 
			  They are however, loosely coupled with each other and use web services and Extensible Markup Language (XML) to communicate. 
			  In this implementation, the database server was located remotely from the data access layer and the engine of the platform and visualization can be done on any client with a geospatial browser (Isikdag & Zlatanova 2010). 
              In the data layer at the lowest level, Oracle spatial 11.2g is propose as the information backend to allow the storage of time-stamped spatial and non-spatial data. 
			  It also contains user data, system logs, 3D models library and metadata (Europeana) of internally or externally available modeling modules and the data services . 
              The data access layer is implemented as part of the middle layer of the architecture. Oracle Data Provider for .NET (ODP.NET) and C# programming language along with .NET Framework 4.0 is used to create an API to communicate between the Oracle database and the Unified Data Model (UDM) developed for the engine of the platform. 
              This API understands the objects in Oracle spatial and is able to execute commands for storage, retrieval and manipulation of data in the database using direct method or stored procedures in the DBMS. 
			  As mentioned earlier, this API can be further extended to work with SQL Server, PostgreSQL or any other databases that support storage, retrieval and different operations on spatial data.  
              Similar to the data access layer, ASP.NET with C# and .NET Framework libraries for their strong OO capabilities are utilized to develop the modular structure of the engine of the platform.  
			  The engine is composed of various modules explained in the framework for data management, user management, modeling workflow engine, object definition and reconfiguration and data processing unit integrated with the visualization coordinator and manager. 
              For assuring the quality of the communication between the above components, as mentioned earlier, a UDM was designed. 
			  It defines the data structure and possible contents which each component in the platform may be required to process or communicate in that specific form. Considering services and XML as the communication medium among components in the platform, XML schemas were utilized by the integrity and consistency checker for validation and data transformation.
              A variety of modeling modules can be developed using C# and integrated with the system using the developed API. These analysis models are then imported as a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file. During the import, they are checked in the system, their metadata are automatically extracted based on the defined attributes in the library and saved in flexible groups of models in the platform. 
			  Later, whenever required, they can be loaded into the memory and used individually or along with other models within the workflow engine component to model a particular scenario.   
			  In this layer, after processing of the data and incorporating the end result of modeling in the workflow engine modeler component, the outcome is sent to the visualization coordinator and based on the communication with the client, the type of visualization technique and technologies to be used at the client- side are determined and suitable data for processing and visualization is sent to the view manager. 
			  The view manager is implemented at the client side using custom-developed Javascript classes and Google Earth API. This component is responsible for communication between the client and the server to manipulate and visualize the 3D environment in one or more viewers. 
			  It will be discussed shortly. 			
              At the highest level of the architecture (presentation layer), on the client-side, “Geospatial web browsers” (Isikdag & Zlatanova 2010) and Google Earth virtual globe viewer, its API and Keyhole Markup Language (KML) along with JavaScript language, is utilized for visualization.  
              Data is exchanged between the visualization coordinator (server-side) and the view manager of the platform (client-side).  In the first attempt in implementation of the platform, XML was utilized for communication between these two modules. 
              Elwannas 2011, but also Wu et al. In 2010  showed that XML has too much overhead in communicating large amount of data. For this reason other technologies were tested to find an alternative data exchange format. In this process, JSON was researched and found as an efficient alternative to XML. 
			  It is text-based (similar to XML) and much more compact and can be flexibly transformed to XML and vice versa. However, choosing JSON require us to develop additional classes at both server and client sides to handle the transmitted JSON data. This data is converted to KML inside the view manager module developed using JavaScript classes in the client. 
			  Google Earth’s API was incorporated for visualization in the viewer. 
			  The view manager is constantly reacting to user actions by querying the server and subsequently processes the responses.   
			  Google Earth (GE) is utilized in this prototype because of its seamless visualization of the Earth along with highly developed API which allows manipulation and visualization at object level and access to their geometry and non-spatial attributes using Document Object Model (DOM).
              Considering the advantages and disadvantages of Google Earth, a number of alternative technologies such as WebGL, 3D web rendering services and visualization pipeline (Hildebrandt & Dollner 2010; Wood et al. 2008) can be considered to be utilized as the viewer for the platform.   
              The User Interface (UI) of the platform could be developed using Dynamic XHTML 4.01 and Ajax. A number of complementary JavaScript libraries such as JQuery and Prototype were also used to complement the developed classes for data visualization and handling client interactions with the UI.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
             The proposed project aims to create a conceptual AVR model combined in a holistic pipeline that incorporates the needs and realities of tourism and heritage perservation within the context of a heritage site as a solution for digitally preserving increasing contextual awareness and attracting global tourists. 
			 To achieve this outcome, it is necessary to carry out an extensive review of the existing approaches used to process and analyse model historic buildings and monuments, and preserve and restore such historic sites, as well as literature related to the combination of several technologies. 
			 A novel integrated approach involving HBIM, 3D GIS, with mixed reality (MR) and transformation between heterogeneous data is proposed. 
			 Therefore, using a combination of data sources collected by multiple technologies, a new integrated approach will be present, that increases context awareness of the architectural heritage of Romania cities, improves users' spatial experience via portable devices, and provides users’ interaction with the environment. 
			 Our focus is multi-disciplinary research concerning both innovative Cultural Heritage Informatics and the use of technology for the digitization, representation, documentation, preservation, and communication of Cultural Heritage knowledge. 
			 This paper serves as a reference source of the architectural heritage and of any changes, and contributes to the understanding of the architectural heritage of the historical elements using of AVR as a novel visualization tool. 
			 It also contributes to the prediction of potential hazards and maintenance requirements of the historical monuments.

            <p>
              Some of technologies proposed in this project are promising and bring strong capabilities, flexibility and extensibility to the architecture of the platform. In contrast, some of the others need reconsideration, and alternative technologies or approaches for their technical improvement should be utilized.
              Today interoperability is starting to become a reality thanks to several international harmonization efforts, trying to solve the problem by offering open computing standards for management of geographical information. 
			  However, there are a number of issues regarding data 3D visualization in a way that maximize usability and provides a profound understanding of the respective information space, fault tolerance, scalability, server-independent implementation,delayed-timetransactions, privacy, thus reﬂecting the need for further research. 
			  This paper illustrate an ongoing research effort which aims at delivering a full infrastructure to access multiple systems with large amounts of complex data sets in an interoperable way, and to process geographical information within a 3D environment through the use of a Service Oriented Architecture.
